## Project Summary 
In our daily lives we often use the same websites without putting too much thought into it. Either browsing Facebook, visiting YouTube, or logging into Netflix, a lot of users have a routine they follow.  Malicious actors can exploit these routines to retrieve valuable data, and private information on unsuspecting users using Pharming. Pharming is the practice of creating deceiving web applications to trick unsuspecting users into sharing private information or downloading malicious software. These “pharm” sites are often made to mimic real websites. On this project we explored how these types of applications are made, and how much information we can gather on the user, we also explore what techniques the user can use to detect the security on when browsing the web.
