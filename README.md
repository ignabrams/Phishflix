### Summary of Background

In this project, we will be working on creating malware, also known as malicious software, and will use it to infect another computer or electronic device. When malware infects a computer it can manipulate or execute actions that could disrupt the device's normal operation. Malware can perform executions like overloading system resources, installing other malware, stealing confidential information, and many other malicious operations. Typically, malware can enter your system through user actions like downloading or clicking suspicious links. Some types of malware are trojan, a typical virus, adware, ransomware, and spyware. To avoid getting your computer or electronic devices infected by malware, it is important to be cautious with the actions you make while browsing the web and installing antimalware. Although antiviruses can help avoid malware, a technique calleed metamorphic code can be used to get past antiviruses by changing its code and avoiding the pattern recognition of the antivirus.

### Project Proposal

**Project Statement:** Our goal with this project is to research the various techniques malwares use in order to avoid detection, mone of these is metamorphic code. By researching this, we can take steps to note what are the vulnerabilities of this type of malware in order to combat it. 

**Project Description:**
- **First Part:** Create a Website that mimics another site that is frequently sed, in our example we are using Netflix, or Phishflix
- **Second Part:** Create an application that functions as an interface in order to trick the user into going through installing the benelovent malware
- **Third Part:** Create a benelovent malware that alerts the user that he has been attacked
- **Fourth Part:** Package everything together, debug, and refactor code that needs to be fixed. (Maintain the program).
- **Fifth Part:** Create a report.

### Roles

**Team Member Roles:** 

- Jorge L. Santos: Development of the different ways the malware can avoid detection (how the malware can hide inside your computer)
- Aaron Tilton: Development of the different ways malware can propagate online (how one can get the malware into their computer)
- Ignacio Abrams: Development of the payload of the malware (how the malware can affect different systems in the computer)

### Timeline

Meetings: Every Friday at 6 PM

#### September:
Research topic of interest.  Have idea of component developed by September 30th.

#### October:
Design phase.  Design how the component will work.  Build framework by October 19.  
Outline component.  Create pseudocode implementation of the component by October 31.

#### November:
Project realization.  Have prototype created by November 10th.  Finish Component by November 25th.

#### November 25th - December
Project finalization.  Merge individual components together to create working, unstoppable, undetectable piece of malware capable of destroying the entire internet.
